--
This package provides a python toolbox for assessing the slow-drifting correlation and causation between two oscialltory timeseries' with multiday patterns. It includes three well-estabilised approaches:

* Empirical Dynamic Modelling (also known as EDM)
* Phase locking value
* Mutual information

## Installation

Command line using the Python pip module: `python -m pip install RITMO`

---

## Usage
